Originally, John Doe was a sham name used to indicate any plaintiff in an
action of ejectment (a legal action to regain property) in civil court [ “
the string that will be base encoded ”]. Richard Roe was the counterpart, to
indicate the defendant. These fake names were used in delicate legal matters,
a practice that was abolished in English law in 1852.
